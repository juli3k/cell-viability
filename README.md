## Project description
A hemocytometer is a device that is essential for quantifying the cell count per volume for any cell-related experiment. These experiments often consider the amount of live and dead cells to find cytotoxicity or the degree to which the experimental variable can cause cell damage/death. alamarBlue, a blue indicator dye, penetrates the cell membrane for dead cells. Our database will consist of at least 100 single hemocytometer squares. Each square will have already been stained with alamarBlue, and the dead cells will have a black dot in the middle to signify the diffusion. The goal of our project is to count the total cells and the amount of live and dead cells.
